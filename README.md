# Wow

That's my dotfiles configuration and stuff, it will mostly work on your machin but as you can imagine
it's a configuration made for my own system

# /etc/locale.conf

If locales are not available, edit locale.gen file
`sudo vim /etc/locale.gen`

regenerate locale
`sudo locale-gen`

```bash
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
DATE=fr_BE.UTF-8
LC_TIME=fr_BE.UTF-8
LC_COLLATE="C"
```
